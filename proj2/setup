## Changelog
##		7/6/2023 - slamel01 - QOL fixes
##			- Remove setup_links
##			- Added better comments
## 			- Always prompts "ok to put material here"
##			- Only times files are copied are when local and source differ (student
##				must confirm overwrite)
##			- Local symlink files are deleted before symlinking again to avoid ln -s error
##		8/27/2023 - slamel01 - update HW with assignments/ subfolder renaming
## 

## Change this for new HWs -- rest of code is boiler plate
HW=proj_calcyoulater

## Directory where we copy from
SOURCEDIR=/comp/15/files/$HW
LINKDIR=$SOURCEDIR/.DONT_COPY

## Make sure student is ok putting stuff in whatever directory they are in.
HERE=$(pwd)
printf "About to put $HW material into $HERE.\n"
printf "Press y to confirm:  "

## For each file to be symlinked
for file in $LINKDIR/*
