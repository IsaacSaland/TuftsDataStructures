Compile/run:
     - Compile using
            make MetroSim
     - run executable with
            ./MetroSim stationsFile passFile [commands]


Program Purpose:
    Act as a train management system where passengers can get on and off the
    train and stations; accept various commands relating to management
    of passengers and movement of the train

Acknowledgements:
    Professor Martin Allen

Files: 

main.cpp:
     runs the simulation of MetroSim; handles user input/output

MetroSim.cpp:
     Implementation of MetroSim class.  Main
     functionality of the Metro Simulation; able to
     move trains and deal with passengers going on/off the train.

MetroSim.h:
     Interface of MetroSim class.

stations.txt:
     an example file containing a list of stations.

test_commands.txt:
     sample list of commands that you could give to the simulator

the_metroSim:
     reference implementation of metrosim 


Note:  the program should handle all cases.

Data Structures:
    The main data structure used was the vector. Each index of the train vector
    acted as each train car, while each index of the stations vector contains
    each station

Testing:

    Aside from the provided tests, I used the unit_test file to test the
    Passenger and PassengerQueue classes. After this, a series of files
    of varying sizes of commands/stations were used to test the MetroSim.
    Bugs encountered include: passengers not getting on the train at the
    correct station, passengers not getting off the train at the correct
    station, etc. These bugs were overcome by moving around method calls within
    the program and then diffing the output, as well as manual testing with
    user input. Cout statements were also used for debugging.

Part that you found most difficult:
    The most difficult part of the MetroSim assignment was managing
    input from both files and cin

Time Spent: 15 hours
